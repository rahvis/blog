# CARS Lab Projects

At [CARS-Lab](http://aminrezaei.com/en/cars-lab) -based on Edsger Dijkstra's great suggestion\*- we work as closely as possible at the boundary of our abilities, and we move forward that boundary with high-quality research; we help the electronics and high-tech industries optimize the underlying hardware for an efficient, reliable, and secure information age.

\*Edsger Dijkstra: Raise your quality standards as high as you can live with, avoid wasting your time on routine problems, and always try to work as closely as possible at the boundary of your abilities. Do this, because it is the only way of discovering how that boundary should be moved forward.
